# 🔧 **Duplicate Appointment Fix Complete!**

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. ✅ Removed Central European Time Dropdown:**
- **Removed**: Timezone selection dropdown
- **Simplified**: Clean sidebar with just "Time format: 24h"
- **Result**: Less clutter, more focused interface

### **2. ✅ Fixed Duplicate Appointment Entries:**
- **Problem**: System was creating TWO events:
  - `Appointment booked: Johannes Nguyen` (renamed freetime)
  - `Appointment: Johannes Nguyen` (separate new event)
- **Solution**: Only rename the freetime event, don't create a separate appointment
- **Result**: Single appointment event with all client details

## 🔄 **How It Works Now:**

### **Before (Duplicate Issue):**
```
1. Create new appointment event: "Appointment: Johannes Nguyen"
2. Rename freetime event: "Appointment booked: Johannes Nguyen"
Result: 2 events in calendar (duplicate!)
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
1. Rename freetime event with full appointment details
Result: 1 event in calendar with all client information
```

## 🎯 **Technical Changes:**

### **Booking Logic (Before):**
```javascript
// Create new appointment
const result = await createAppointmentEvent(appointmentData);

// Also rename freetime slot
await renameFreeTimeSlot(selectedSlot.originalEvent, clientName);
// Result: 2 events created!
```

### **Booking Logic (After):**
```javascript
// Only rename freetime slot with full appointment data
const result = await renameFreeTimeSlot(selectedSlot.originalEvent, appointmentData);
// Result: 1 event with all details!
```

### **Event Details:**
The single appointment event now contains:
- **Title**: `Appointment: Johannes Nguyen`
- **Description**: Full client details (name, email, phone, notes)
- **Location**: Client-specified location
- **Time**: Original freetime slot time
- **All metadata**: Complete appointment information

## 🎨 **UI Improvements:**

### **Sidebar (Before):**
```
📅 Book Appointment
⏱️ Select a time slot
Time format: 24h
[Central European Time (CET) ▼]  ← REMOVED
```

### **Sidebar (After):**
```
📅 Book Appointment
⏱️ Select a time slot
Time format: 24h
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Cleaner interface** - no unnecessary timezone dropdown
- ✅ **Less confusion** - timezone is handled automatically
- ✅ **Simpler design** - focused on essential information

## 📅 **Calendar Result:**

### **Before (Duplicate):**
```
Calendar Events:
- Appointment booked: Johannes Nguyen (12:30-13:00) [No details]
- Appointment: Johannes Nguyen (12:30-13:00) [Full details]
```

### **After (Single Event):**
```
Calendar Events:
- Appointment: Johannes Nguyen (12:30-13:00) [Full details]
  Client: Johannes Nguyen
  Email: johannes@gmail.com
  Phone: 017661238259
